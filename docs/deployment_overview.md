# HiveMind Copilot Complete Deployment Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview for deploying the entire HiveMind Copilot system, including both the backend AI service and the frontend VSCode extension.

## System Architecture

HiveMind Copilot consists of two main components:

1. **Backend AI Service**: A Python-based FastAPI service that provides:
   - Context-aware code generation using CodeLlama
   - Error resolution using LangChain and Hedera Mirror Node
   - Test generation for Hedera code
   - Knowledge retrieval from Hedera documentation

2. **Frontend VSCode Extension**: A TypeScript-based VSCode extension that provides:
   - User interface for interacting with the backend
   - Code editor integration
   - Sidebar with multiple functionality tabs
   - Chat interface for developer assistance

## Deployment Workflow

For a complete deployment, follow these steps in order:

1. Deploy the backend service
2. Configure and test the backend API
3. Build and package the VSCode extension
4. Distribute the extension to developers

## Quick Start

### Backend Deployment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hivemind-copilot.git
cd hivemind-copilot

# Set up backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration

# Start the server
python -m src.api.main
```

### Frontend Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run compile

# Package the extension
npx vsce package
```

The packaged extension (.vsix file) can now be distributed to developers.

## Configuration Matrix

| Environment | Backend Deployment | Frontend Configuration |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Development | Local Python      | Local VSCode Extension  |
| Testing     | Docker Container  | .vsix Package          |
| Production  | Cloud Service     | VSCode Marketplace     |

## System Requirements

### Backend Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- 2 vCPUs minimum
- 10GB disk space
- Internet access for API calls

### Frontend Requirements
- Node.js 16+
- VSCode 1.60+
- Network access to backend service

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Backend Monitoring
- Use the `/health` endpoint for service health checks
- Monitor logs for error patterns
- Set up alerts for service disruptions

### Frontend Updates
- Distribute new versions through your chosen distribution channel
- Communicate changes to users
- Provide update documentation

## Security Considerations

1. **API Security**:
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement API key authentication
   - Rate limit requests

2. **Data Security**:
   - Do not store sensitive code or credentials
   - Implement proper data isolation
   - Follow data retention policies

3. **Dependency Security**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Scan for vulnerabilities
   - Follow security best practices

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to:

- [Backend Deployment Guide](./backend_deployment_guide.md)
- [Frontend Deployment Guide](./frontend_deployment_guide.md)

## Support and Troubleshooting

For common issues and solutions, refer to the troubleshooting sections in each deployment guide.

For additional support:
- Check the GitHub repository issues
- Contact the development team
- Refer to Hedera documentation for platform-specific issues

## Version Compatibility

Ensure version compatibility between components:

| Backend Version | Frontend Version | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| 0.1.x           | 0.1.x            | Initial release |
| 0.2.x           | 0.2.x            | Added chat functionality |

Always deploy matching versions of backend and frontend for full compatibility.
